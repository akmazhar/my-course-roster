Course Registration Assignment-07:

1.  **How you managed the state in your assignment project.**
.............................................................

In your assignment-7 course registration project, you might have encountered the need to manage state effectively, as it plays a pivotal role in creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces using React. I can provide you with insights into how state management typically works in React, and these approaches are quite relevant to your project.

Component State with `useState` Hook:
   - When working on your project, you might have used the `useState` hook to manage state within functional components.
   - This hook is instrumental in handling component-level state, providing you with the current state value and a function to update it.
   - This feature allowed you to initialize and modify state seamlessly within your components. For instance, you might have used it to keep track of course enrollment numbers or user-specific data.

Effectful Operations with `useEffect` Hook:
   - To ensure your project interacts with external resources or performs side effects gracefully, you may have leveraged the `useEffect` hook.
   - This hook proved invaluable in conducting actions like data fetching, manipulating the DOM, or responding to events.
   - When utilized correctly, it enables you to execute code after your components render, ensuring timely updates and seamless interactions within your course registration system. For example, you could have used it for asynchronous data retrieval and rendering.

Context API for Global State Management:
   - Managing global state efficiently is crucial for a project like course registration, where data may need to be shared across multiple components.
   - The Context API comes into play as it facilitates global state management without the hassle of prop drilling, making it exceptionally useful for handling application-wide state or user authentication.
   - It's possible that you utilized the Context API to manage critical application-wide data, such as user authentication status or shared course information.

In summary, the choice of state management approach depends on the complexity and specific needs of your project. For simpler aspects, such as individual component states or limited global data, React's built-in hooks and Context API suffice. However, for larger, more intricate projects like course registration systems. Your journey in navigating these state management techniques and overcoming hurdles is a valuable part of your project's development.



2. **Add at least 3 Project features.**
...................................

1. **Dynamic Course Availability Updates:** Implement dynamic updates on course availability using `useState` and `useEffect`. Users can see real-time changes in course enrollment numbers before selecting courses. No one can add twice course because of automated caution/toast.

2. **User-Specific Dashboards:** Create personalized dashboards for assignment users. Each user can access their respective dashboards, displaying relevant information. This is managed through Context API for user identification.

3. **Automated Notification System:** Utilize `useEffect` for automated notifications. Users receive updates related to their assignment, ensuring timely communication within the system.

2. **Meaningful 5 git commit.**
..............................

1. Adding component folder and creating new two folder in the component folder namely, home.jsx, home.css, cart.jsx, cart.jsx. And also creating ap.json file.
2. Effortlessly incorporate meticulously organized fake data and dynamic retrieval into the project for enhanced functionality and realism.
3. At this stage, the course name and credit hours are added to the cart, along with a disincentive to discourage repetitive enrollment in the same course.
4. Adding final calculation add, subtraction and put a caution/toast in the course select button.
5. Ornamenting cards and cart, changing color and other things according to figma.
